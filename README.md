# The_Bank_Of_The_Future

This project was completed as the final project during the Data Analysis Bootcamp with Le Wagon and Saudi Digital Academy. The main goal of the project was to analyze a neobank dataset and address the business need of reducing churn rate.

## Business need üíº

The business need of this project was to address the challenge of customer churn within the neobank. Customer churn which is customers that are no longer using the bank for various reasons. Our aim was to analyze user behavior, engagement levels, and retention patterns to identify churners and generate recommendations to enhance customer retention strategies.

## Project Timeline ‚åõÔ∏è

The project had a timeline of two weeks, during which my team and I worked collaboratively to explore, clean, transform, and analyze the neobank dataset. We also visualized the data to gain meaningful insights.

## Methodology üî¨
1. Data Exploration: We thoroughly explored the neobank dataset, gaining a deep understanding of its variables, structure, and potential insights.
2. Data Cleaning and Transformation: We conducted rigorous data cleaning and transformation tasks, addressing missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies to ensure the dataset's integrity and quality using SQL and Python.
3. Data Analysis: A detailed analysis of the dataset was conducted, focusing on user behavior, engagement, and retention. This analysis aimed to identify churners and uncover key factors contributing to customer attrition.
Hypothesis Creation: In order to guide our data analysis, we formulated hypotheses that served as focal points for our analysis. These hypotheses directed our attention towards specific aspects of the data, enabling us to conduct targeted analyses and derive meaningful insights.
5. Machine Learning: Leveraging tools such as Google Colab, we applied advanced machine learning algorithms to predict and classify churners.
6. Data Visualization: To effectively communicate our findings and insights, we employed Looker Studio and Canva to create visually appealing and informative data visualizations report. These visualizations helped stakeholders comprehend the analysis results and make informed decisions.

## Tools Used üõ†
* Google BigQuery: Utilized for querying and analyzing the neobank dataset.
* Google Colab: Employed for coding, data analysis, machine learning algorthims and preforme A/B tests.
* Looker Studio: Utilized for creating interactive and visually appealing data visualizations.
* Notion: Utilized for project management, collaboration, and documentation.
* Canva: Used for designing visually appealing presentation that include charts and infographics.


## The report üìà
Our report is a comprehensive overview of the project, comprising multiple pages with distinct titles. Each page focuses on a specific topic and contains a collection of charts that are relevant to that topic. The charts within each page share a common theme and provide valuable insights into various aspects of the analysis.
